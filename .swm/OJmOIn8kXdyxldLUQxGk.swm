    "summary": "In this unit we've learned about the use of `asyncio.gather` and how it allows us to await on several coroutines at the same time, allowing them to run concurrently!\n\nIf you're still unsure about the difference between concurrency and parallelism, read back the recommended references. Concurrent execution is a hard concept to grasp at first, but after reading and practicing it will come as second nature!",
